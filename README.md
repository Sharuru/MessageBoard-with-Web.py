# MessageBoard-with-Web.py

## Intro
MessageBoard with Web.py is a light messageboard system worked with Web.py, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2 & Bootstrap based on Python 2.7.8.

## Advantage
Easy to use, easy to config and easy to customize.  

## Usage
+ Clone this repositoriy to everywhere you like.  
+ Set your database.  
    + System will create tables when you first run it so you do not need to worry about it very well. But for **MySQL users**, you should need to set your own database and add it to **models.py** by yourself.   
    + Then run: ```python models.py```  
* Set your admin account info.
    + After running models.py successfully, you may find your database file in directory, set your admin account and password in table 'admin'.  
* Run ```python main.py```  

### That's the GOAL! Enjoy your Own MessageBoard! |ω・´)
